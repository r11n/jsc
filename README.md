# Javascript ES6 in-depth with React
![JS image](contents01.jpg)
In this course we will be building a weather forecasting react application using the **openweather** API.
term `aTrivia` is used to give a vague idea about the assignments that will be given in the chapter.

**Note:** Course structure is built considering most of the learners are beginners. The first two chapters might take more time than any others.

## Introduction to JS
A basic introduction to javascript and its implications
* Hello JS
    - history, syntax
    - Internet & How browser works
    - Difference between HTML, CSS and JS
    - Understanding Browser Console
* Variables
    - Declaration & Assignment
    - Case Sensitivity in naming
* Operators
    - `+, -, *, /, %, ++, --,`
    - Compound Assignment(`+=, -=, *=, /=`)
    - Conditional Operators(`==, >, <, >=, <=, ?:`)
* Escape Sequences
    - the backslash(`\`) literals
* Arrays & their operations
    - functions on arrays(`push, pop, shift, unshift`)
* Functions
    - defining and reusing
    - return statement
* Scope of `var`
    - global and local scopes
* Conditional Statements
    - `if, else, switch`
* Loops
    - `for, while`
* try?
    - `try, catch`
* The JS `Math` module
    - about the usability of js `Math`
* `DOM` and its `events`
    - URL
    - Event loop
    - async apis
* Others
    - webservice
    - REST vs SOAP

**aTrivia:** Downloading the city dataset(around 200K cities) from openweather and perform actions on it such as creating a json object...

## ES6 and other buddies
This chapter gives an in-depth idea about the new features in the ES6 standard.
* what is ES6?
* The differences
    - `let, const`
    - `let` vs `var`
    - `Promise`?
    - Mutation & freezing
    - The Arrow(`()=>`) function
    - Rest parameters and the spread operator
    - Destructive Assignment
    - concise object literals
    - Templating
    - Class syntax with getter and setter
    - `import` vs `require`
* The Other buddies
    - Regular Expressions
    - Debugging
    - Functional programming
    - high order functions

**aTrivia:** Wrap a general XMLHttpRequest into a promise in order to reuse that in making API calls and fetching the data. generating our own prototype function over a object and some other assignments that helps in understanding the ES6 features along with regex etc.,

## Node.js & its friends
* what is `node.js`?
* what is package manager?
* `npm, yarn ...`
* integrating third party libraries without `npm`
* integrating libs with `npm`

## Why React?
* Virtual DOM
    - advantages of VDOM
    - differences without using VDOM
* Reusability
    - examples
* Hirable

**aTrivia:** Building a sample react component, build the same component without using react...

## React Notations
* `jsx`
* `State`
* `Props`
* `Context`
* lifecycle events

**aTrivia:** Building components that will make the learner understand each of the notations

## Styling Compontents
* A brief intro to CSS
* Inline Styling
* CSS-in-JS
* Styling using external libraries

**aTrivia:** Building components in different styling variations. building individual static weather type components(sunny, haze etc.,)

## Building the React Application
* Syntax Standards
* Re-usable library functions
* How to use React context
* Advanced integrations
    - Routing
    - Authentication

**aTrivia:** Building the final app with options like theme switch etc.,
